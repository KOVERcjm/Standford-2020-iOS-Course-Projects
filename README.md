# Standford-2020-iOS-Course-Projects
This repository is to record the learning progress of [Standford Open Course CS193p](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/) (2020 spring version).

The branches are marked after each Lecture is finished. Besides the basic functional code that is recorded, I will try to put down all useful points (maybe in comments) as much as possible for review.

# Lecture 1
In this lecture, the lecture introduced basic concepts of iOS, Swift and SwiftUI, and builded a basic Memorize Game UI which contains 4 cards in horizon.
